ZFS-Geek-Backup

Summary:
Using rsync and zfs snapshots you can do incremental backups to removeable drives.
So that you can better understand how it works I will explain my system then you can adapt to yours.

I have a hard drive dock http://www.google.ca/search?q=hard+drive+dock and 5 old used hard drives.Each
of the five drives has been configured as a zfs pool named MyBackup.

I have a NAS4Free system with one pool:
pool: My320POOL
state: ONLINE
scan: scrub repaired 0 in 1h12m with 0 errors on Fri Mar  1 12:09:30 2013
config:
My320POOL   ONLINE       0     0     0
mirror-0  ONLINE       0     0     0
ada1    ONLINE       0     0     0
ada0    ONLINE       0     0     0
errors: No known data errors

I have created several Datasets
NAME USED AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
My320POOL           184G   110G  44.5K  /mnt/My320POOL
My320POOL/data     1.48G   110G  1.47G  /mnt/My320POOL/data
My320POOL/install  11.1G   110G  11.1G  /mnt/My320POOL/install
My320POOL/music    7.62G   110G  7.62G  /mnt/My320POOL/music
My320POOL/photo    14.5G   110G  14.5G  /mnt/My320POOL/photo
My320POOL/video     149G   110G   149G  /mnt/My320POOL/video

While I could backup all Datasets I am only interested in backing up some of them.

Look in the backup script for this variable:
DATASETS=('data' 'photo') // Backup data and photo

Other Examples:
DATASETS=('photo') // Just photo
DATASETS=('data' 'install' 'music' 'photo' 'video') // All my datasets

The only other change you'll need to make is:
SOURCEPOOL=My320POOL

Example:
SOURCEPOOL=TANK


NOTES N' TIPS

Get rid of all snapshots on MyBackup:
  zpool import MyBackup
  zfs list -H -o name -t snapshot | grep MyBackup | xargs -n1 zfs destroy
  zpool export MyBackup

Get a clean start on an existing MyBackup drive:
  zpool import MyBackup
  zpool destroy MyBackup
  zpool create MyBackup da1
  zpool export MyBackup

Add yet another drive to your collection of backup drives:
  zpool create MyBackup da1
  zpool export MyBackup
  
  *It's da1 on my machine but will likely be something else on yours

You may run the backup at anytime:
./zfs-geek-backup.sh
./zfs-geek-backup.sh -q  //quiet, only errors will output
